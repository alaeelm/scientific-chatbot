Scientific Chatbot using RAG and NLP Models
This project is a scientific chatbot designed to assist users—such as students, researchers, and domain experts—in retrieving and understanding scientific information from a knowledge base of research articles. Using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Language Models (LLMs), the chatbot provides accurate and contextually relevant answers tailored to the user's expertise level.

The chatbot is built on a pipeline of models for text retrieval, document re-ranking, and answer generation, ensuring responses are sourced from relevant and trustworthy research articles. This project showcases how AI can be applied to support scientific research and make complex information more accessible.
